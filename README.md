# Hello Everyone, Simon here;

Due to the start of my last university year and the complexity of my studies (Applied Physics and Quantum Mechanics). My github commits won't be as daily as they usually are.

Along side that, I'm currently part-time / moonlight studing Advanced Javascript along side some new 3D software to make better websites and fill that empty portfolio page in my website [Simonlabs](https://simonlabs.vercel.app)

If you're wondering, I have made over 20 projects during the summer *from exo-planet generators to note taking apps*. But I feel they lack a certain quality i'm looking for. That's why I'll leave to learn for a while, until my world is less chaotic and cramped as it is right now.

i'll be updating my website every once and while, and if you have any questions: make sure to contact me [Here](https://simonlabs.vercel.app/contact) or send me an email on saadabou.study@gmail.com

expected return: July 2023.
